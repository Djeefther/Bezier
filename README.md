This project shows a Bezier line in the screen while the user could change the control points. Runs on Windows and uses the Visual Studio 2013 to compile, using C++ and OpenGL 2.0. This project is self-contained and the parts of OpenGL need are already in this folder.

The usage of the Software allows to change, add and remove points of control to produce a Bezier Line that draws iteratively or a static one. If you need help press 'H' and a help window says the commands you could type.  Click on the screen introduce a new point or change a control point. At least two control points are needed to see a form, but please, try more of 2.
